        <h2>My Experience So Far</h2>
        <p>
            Learning HTML has helped me understand how websites are structured. I learned how to use GIT HUB and through this how we can help each other wiht our HTML through this platform. 
            It was overwhelming at start but as slowly as you understand things and the more you practice it beecomes easier.
